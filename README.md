Android Project Template
==================

This repository is for my Android Project Template, structured using Clean Artchitecture and Jetpack Compose UI. It is a **work in progress** ðŸš§.

**Android Project Template** is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It
follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference
for developers.


# Features

- Coming Soon.


# Development Environment

**Android Project Template** uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into Android Studio (make sure you are using the latest stable version available [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)). 


# Architecture

The **Android Project Template** app follows the
[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) 
and is described in detail in the
[architecture learning journey](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md).


# Build

The app contains the usual `debug` and `release` build variants. 

The app also uses
[product flavors](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors)

For normal development use the `demoDebug` variant. For UI performance testing use the
`demoRelease` variant. 


# UI
The app was designed using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). 

The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
